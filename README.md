# Olif - An ontology mapping language for data interchange formats
<hr>
With Olif, you can define custom mappings to transform RDF data into XML or JSON. Based on the ideas of [RML](https://rml.io/) because we ‚ù§Ô∏è RML

## About
You took time and efforts and created a semantic model for all your heterogeneous data sources. Then you need to use some slice of those information and import it into a legacy tool. But this legacy tool only supports XML or JSON imports. How do you get the relevant parts of your semantic model in the form that your legacy tool accepts? With Olif you can define mapping rules that transform selected parts of your ontology into XML or JSON with a structure you define.

## Usage
Define mappings using the Olif mapping language in a so-called _mapping model_. We recommend to write a Turtle file, but other RDF serialization formats should work just fine, too. See this example:

```turtle

@prefix ol: <http://www.hsu-hh.de/aut/ontologies/olif#>.
# Your other prefix definitions
...
<#ParameterMapping> a ol:DataMap;
  ol:ontologicalSource [
    ol:source "parameters.ttl";
	  ol:sourceType ol:File;
    ol:queryLanguage ql:Sparql;
    ol:query 
      "PREFIX ex: <http://www.hsu-hh.de/aut/ontologies/example#> 
      SELECT ?parameterName ?parameterValue WHERE {
        ?parameter a ex:Parameter.
        ex:RobotConfiguration_ABC a ex:RobotConfiguration;
        ex:hasParameter ?parameter.
        ?parameter ex:hasName ?parameterName;
          ex:hasValue ?parameterValue.
      }"
  ];
  ol:referenceFormulation "XPath";
  ol:container "/parameters";
  ol:snippet 
   "<ParamWithValue>
      <name>length_${parameterName}</name>
      <typeCode>mm</typeCode>
      <value >${parameterValue} mm</value>
    </ParamWithValue>".

A `DataMap` is the class for all Olif mapping definitions. Every `DataMap` has to have an `ontologicalSource` which specifies the source data to be mapped:
- `source` defines a file path to a source ontology or the URL of a SPARQL endpoint
- `sourceType` is used to specify whether a `File` or `SparqlEndpoint` is used
- `queryLanguage`defines the language used to retrieve information from the `source`. We currently support only `Sparql`, but will maybe support other ways of retrieving data in the future
- `query` contains the actual query string used to retrieve data from the source. Results of this query can be used to insert dynamic data into the mapping output. In the above example, the variable `?parameterName` and `?parameterValue` are used inside the `snippet`.

While `ontologicalSource` is used to define the source of a mapping, `container` and `snippet` declare the output structure. The string connected to a `DataMap` via `container` is a search expression in the output document that determines into which existing structure the mapping is executed. In case this structure doesn't exist, it is created. In the example above, an XML tag `parameters` is searched. The `container` string may contain variables of the SPARQL Query so that results of the query are inserted before searching.

The `snippet` defines the actual mapping output which is inserted into the container. It is a string that may also contain variables of the SPARQL query. In the example above, a parameter structure is defined with a dynamic name and value.
